# NOTES:
# * The form of strings representing operating system paths should look like
#   this, without quotes:
#       C:/Source/TIGER/www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/tiger2006se
#
# * UNC (network) paths work as well:
#       //home-pc/C$/Source/TIGER/www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/tiger2006se
#
# * You can use either forward or backslashes.  The paths are normalized
#   before reading them.
